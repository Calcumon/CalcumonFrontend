  This is a redundant stylesheet;
  everything used is already in `login.css`.
  The desireable codebase would have one css file
  per tsx component, however in this case it was
  causing confusion and uneccessary not-DRY-ness.
  (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  We think that webpack might be the underlying cause
  for the issues that we experienced.
